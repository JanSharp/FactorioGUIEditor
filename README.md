# GUI Editor

This is the project for a GUI editor for Factorio GUI inside of Factorio. It's highly WIP and to save myself the stress I'm not going to guarantee it ever being done. It's up on github purely for sharing purposes at the moment.

Note that it's currently depending on Phobos `0.1.4` which isn't released yet, if you _really_ wanted to clone it and play around. You'd have to clone phobos, check out the `0.1.x` branch and run the publish script (with the right arguments to skip everything except building and packaging or something. use `-h` first.)
